# EZStudy

## Inspiration
During the pandemic, students worldwide face challenges in online learning, struggling to maintain focus and productivity. To address this, I implemented the scientifically proven Pomodoro technique, breaking study time into 25-minute work periods followed by 5-minute breaks.

## What it does
EZStudy is a comprehensive platform where users can apply the Pomodoro technique for efficient studying. It also facilitates learning, task management, music playback, and breaks without leaving the site. Users can create to-do lists, search subjects on YouTube, access math tools, and study with resources like Wolfram Alpha and Quizlet.

## How I built it
I developed EZStudy using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Google Firebase, leveraging their capabilities to create a user-friendly and functional study platform.

## Challenges I ran into
Some challenges I ran into included sequencing timer events, and CSS positioning. Overcoming these hurdles ensured a smooth study cycle and site functionality.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I'm proud of EZStudy's rapid development and completion within the hackathon timeframe. The platform's versatility, ease of use, and global accessibility are significant achievements.

## What I learned
Participating in this hackathon significantly expanded my JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills. I also improved my deadline management skills, which are vital for successful project execution.

## What's next for EZStudy
My future goals include expanding EZStudy into a cross-platform app and integrating AI to personalize study recommendations based on user habits and preferences.
